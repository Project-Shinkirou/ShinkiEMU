ShinkiEMU is pre-release software. Builds are published as beta releases. A successful build does not mean that a given game is verified playable. Per-game reports are in the [portal](https://project-shinkirou.github.io/en/shinkiemu/).

## Features

- **Manager.** One desktop and mobile app for your game library, cores, metadata (Bangumi, VNDB) and store accounts (Steam, DLsite, DMM).
- **Native cores.** Each core keeps its engine's own VM, rendering, audio, menus and saves. The Manager hosts cores through one C ABI ([Core ABI](docs/en/core-abi.md)).
- **Separately released cores.** Cores are released and updated independently of the Manager, and installed from the in-app catalog.
- **Mobile embedding.** Android and iOS Managers link the supported cores statically; desktop Managers load downloaded core libraries.
- **Upstream engines stay upstream.** External cores are thin adapters on organization forks of existing open-source engine reimplementations. Their saves, keys and settings keep upstream locations and formats.
- **Your game directory stays clean.** Files ShinkiEMU itself writes in a game directory go under `<game>/.shinki/`.

[`build/cores.toml`](build/cores.toml) and [`build/targets.toml`](build/targets.toml) define this matrix; run `cargo xtask matrix` for every combination with its blocked reason. The [core directory](https://project-shinkirou.github.io/en/shinkiemu/cores/) lists what is actually published. OpenHarmony is declared but blocked for every component.

## Install

1. Download the Manager bundle for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/Project-Shinkirou/ShinkiEMU/releases).
2. Extract it and start `shinki-emu-manager` (`shinki-emu-manager.exe` on Windows).
3. On Linux, install the runtime libraries listed in [Build and release](docs/en/build-and-release.md#linux-desktop).

Android builds are currently debug-signed test APKs, not release installers.

## Quick start

1. In Settings, add the directories that contain your games.
2. Install or update the cores your games need from the core catalog.
3. Select a game in the library and launch it.

The [user guide](docs/en/user-guide.md) covers configuration, saves, metadata and patches.

## Building from source

Clone with submodules and use the pinned Rust 1.99.1 toolchain. All build, packaging and release steps are `cargo xtask` commands run from the repository root:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Project-Shinkirou/ShinkiEMU
cd ShinkiEMU
cargo xtask doctor --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc          # report missing prerequisites
cargo xtask deps --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --all-cores
cargo xtask build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --manager --release
cargo xtask build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --core rfvp --release
cargo xtask test --core rfvp
```

`deps` fetches each external core's fork at the exact revision pinned in `build/cores.toml`, along with its locked native dependencies. Platform prerequisites (MSVC, Linux packages, Android NDK, the Ren'Py SDK), packaging and releases are in [Build and release](docs/en/build-and-release.md).

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request. To write a new core or bring an existing engine in as a core, follow the agent skills in [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/). Never commit commercial game data; tests use synthetic fixtures.

## Reporting issues

Use the issue forms:

- [Bug report](https://github.com/Project-Shinkirou/ShinkiEMU/issues/new?template=bug.yml)
- [Game compatibility report](https://github.com/Project-Shinkirou/ShinkiEMU/issues/new?template=compatibility.yml)
- [Patch submission](https://github.com/Project-Shinkirou/ShinkiEMU/issues/new?template=patch.yml)

Problems in an external engine itself may also belong upstream; each core page links its upstream project.

## License

Project-owned code is dual-licensed under [MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or [Apache-2.0](LICENSE-APACHE), at your option. External cores, dependencies and assets keep their own licenses: see [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and [ORIGINS.md](ORIGINS.md). Each core release ships a sources archive with the corresponding source.

[RoukakuEngine](https://github.com/Project-Shinkirou/RoukakuEngine) is the separate creation engine that ShinkiEMU's shared libraries come from.
