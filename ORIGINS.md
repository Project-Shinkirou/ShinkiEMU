# Origins

ShinkiEMU starts a new Git history. Its code and data come from repositories by the same authors; the original histories stay there.

| https://github.com/Project-Shinkirou/Project-Shinkirou.github.io (`main`) | `59853af07f2a6ed32bc21b4ab6d014287f8f3814` | `docs/assets/readme-banner-{dark,light}.png`, rendered from the portal's `MirageScene.astro` night scene, `theme.css` night and dawn tokens, and `LogoMark.astro` mark |
| https://github.com/Shizuku-in/cmvs-rs (`main`) | `b9fed68ba05f80444338331bb3999f14c8f4f976` | External CMVS/CVNS core `cmvs-rs`, alongside the independent `shinki.emu.cmvs`; fork `Project-Shinkirou/cmvs-rs`, branch `shinki`, adapter pin `b8de741dca3737d03351a5a45531616dff7ea39a`.

External cores live in organization forks that keep their upstream history and attribution; ShinkiEMU pins them as submodules on their `shinki` branches (`cpal` and `kira` on version maintenance branches).

All own identifiers were renamed (`astra-emu-*` → `shinki-emu-*`, `astra_emu_query` → `shinki_emu_query`, `astra.emu.*` → `shinki.emu.*`, shared engine crates `astra-*` → `roukaku-*` from [RoukakuEngine](https://github.com/Project-Shinkirou/RoukakuEngine)). Data directories, packages, caches and saves written by AstraEMU are not read by ShinkiEMU; original game saves are untouched.
